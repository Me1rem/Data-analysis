## Conclusion
The analysis reveals key patterns in customer behavior and financial product preferences. Mastercard’s dominance and the popularity of debit cards suggest that customers prioritize convenience, security, and direct spending over credit reliance. The high average income among youths (18-35) indicates that this demographic is financially active and a prime market for financial institutions. The surge in account openings in 2020 could be attributed to economic shifts, increased digital banking adoption, or financial policies introduced during that period. Lastly, the large number of expiring cards post-2020 presents an opportunity for banks to implement targeted retention strategies, such as renewal incentives or upgraded financial products, to maintain customer loyalty.
